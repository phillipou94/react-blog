              <p>Hi there 👋!</p>
              <p>I’m Phil. I'm a Google Product Manager who moonlights as a PM coach and Substack blogger</p>
              <p>Welcome to my humble diary of things I’m thinking through “out loud” where I roam over subjects like technology, economics, personal development, and current events.</p>
              <p>I won’t claim to be an expert in any of these topics but they’re all personally interesting to me and I hope writing about them will help clarify my own thinking and point of view.</p>
              <p>This will mostly be a self-serving venture but maybe—just maybe—you’ll benefit from it as much as I do 🙂</p>
